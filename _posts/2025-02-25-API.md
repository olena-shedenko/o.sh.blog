Many of us have heard about APIs. For those who aren’t connected to the IT world, it’s hard to understand what this acronym means and what it serves.
I heard about it when I started learning programming in 2020, but this word sounded too complex to comprehend. How can I explain this acronym in just a few simple words so everyone will understand it?

Today is Sunday, I want to take my kids to the cinema. There are a lot of questions to answer, like who is coming and which seats to choose. I open a cinema app and book the tickets, then I need to pay for them, and then I need to receive my e-tickets. But how can I do it? That’s when the scary word API comes up.

Let’s define what an API, or Application Programming Interface, is. The term “application” means a computer program that is designed for a particular purpose. The term “programming” means the process or skill of writing programs for computers. The term “interface” refers to how a computer or mobile phone can be connected to or used with another system. In other words, an API is how the different systems interact with each other. Similar to how two people talk, there should be a common language between them, so an API is like the common language between applications.

When I launch the cinema app, book tickets, and make a payment, I interact with many APIs, and I am even not aware of it. For example, if my app requires me to log in or register and there is an option to do it using Facebook, Google, or Apple and I click to log in via a social media account, then the app sends the request to this platform and asks for my identification, and this feature is enabled by an API. 

Again, if I want to pay for my tickets and click pay, the app sends the request to the bank payment system and receives permission to access the information it needs to complete the transaction. Is it safe? Yes, because an API requires proper authentication and security to ensure only authorized access, it receives the access it needs to complete the transaction but cannot access the customer’s sensitive data; it encrypts all API messages to prevent tracking of data in transit and validates all input data to prevent attacks that can compromise the server through the API.

Let's look at some real examples of popular APIs that you can use regularly:

**The Google Maps API** allows any application to embed Google Maps. This simplifies the addition of mapping functions without creating complex mapping software from scratch.

**Stripe API** allows applications and websites to easily accept payments without having to meet complex financial and regulatory requirements related to payment processing.

**Darksky Weather API** provides current and future weather data such as precipitation probability, temperature, etc. that weather applications rely on.

**YouTube API** allows you to embed videos from YouTube in other applications and create custom YouTube clients.

## How does an API work?

1.  API work starts with one program (client) sending a request to another program (server) via the API and it usually includes parameters that indicate what information or function the client requests.  
2. When the server receives a request, it processes it. Depending on the request, the server can extract the required data from the database, perform a certain operation or call the corresponding function within its system.  
3. After processing the request, the server sends the response back to the client. The response may contain requested data, status of operation or error message if something went wrong. Most often, the response is transmitted in JSON or XML format, which makes it convenient for further processing and use in the client application.
4. The client program receives a response from the API and uses it as intended. For example, if it was a request to get a list of products from an online store, the application will show the user this list.

In this way, the API allows your app to access data  from other systems using standard queries and responses, making integration simple and easy.

Now that you understand the basics of APIs, let's talk about why they provide so much value:

* APIs hide all the intricate details and associated complexities "under the hood.". This allows developers to easily use the functionality without creating everything from scratch.
* Using existing APIs and code significantly saves time and effort during development.
* Once the API is created and publicly available, any number of applications can use it, which leads to reusability.
* APIs make it easy to scale to large user bases without having to handle the workload directly.
* Companies like Google and Twitter provide APIs that allow them to monetize their platforms by further expanding usage.

Whether it's payment processing, mapping, messaging, or more, APIs provide basic functionality out of the box.


API simplifies the process of creating different apps, e-commerce, and websites and helps to develop tools that interact seamlessly with their data. APIs have prepacked reusable elements that are already tested and ready to use; that saves time for development and speeds up the time to completion of any application.
