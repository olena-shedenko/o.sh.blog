Adolphe – The novel by Henri-Benjamin Constant de Rebecque

The idea for the novel arose in Constant in the fall of 1806. In September, he arrived in Rouen, where his beloved Madame de Staël was staying (their relationship had already lasted twelve years). In 1802, she had been exiled from Paris by Napoleon’s order. Constant intended to continue working on a large essay on political topics in Rouen, but he suddenly received a letter from Paris from an old friend, Charlotte Duterte (née von Hardenberg). Having met Charlotte in the capital, he was first flattered by her attention and then captivated by her charm—and most importantly, her meekness. In this respect, she was the complete opposite of the domineering Germaine de Staël.
After spending about two weeks in Paris, he returned to Madame de Staël, who was grieving his absence. The need to hide his new feelings made his position near his former lover even more burdensome, and the lack of peace of mind prevented him from working on serious political compositions. So Constant turned to art. On October 30, 1806, as noted in his diary, he began writing a novel. At first, he intended to tell the story of his love for Charlotte, but already in November, alongside the mention of the “novel” in his diary, the “episode with Ellenora” begins to appear. Gradually, this “episode” took over his attention, and Constant, having postponed the initial idea, focused solely on it. As a result, by mid-November, the first sketch of what would become Adolphe was ready, and by early January 1807, the work (now called a novel) was completely finished.

Thus, while Charlotte triumphed over Germaine in Constant’s personal life (he and Charlotte secretly married in June 1808), in literature, the victory remained with Germaine. However, she was not the only prototype for Adolphe’s beloved, Ellenora. This heroine also drew inspiration from other women in Constant’s life—Jules Talma (the divorced wife of the great tragedian) and Anna Lindsay, the daughter of an Irish innkeeper raised in an aristocratic Parisian family. The story of Mrs. Lindsay’s relationship with Constant was later told in her own words in the novel Ellenora (1844–1846) by Sophie Ge. Many of Ellenora’s traits are closely linked to Madame de Staël.
This connection became unmistakable when a reading of the novel in her salon at the end of December 1806 ended in a grand scandal. Madame de Staël’s inner circle was wary of Constant’s work. From that point on, he never read Adolphe in her presence again. Ten years later, after the novel was published, he was more pleased by Madame de Staël’s favorable reception than by the laudatory newspaper reviews. In earlier years, fear of offending Germaine and provoking her anger had led Constant to reject offers from publishers. However, after their final break in 1811, he read the novel aloud in German and French salons, often moving both secular listeners and himself to tears. Thus, Adolphe was well known in Parisian circles even before its official publication, which Constant finally authorized in 1816.
The Paris and London editions of Adolphe appeared almost simultaneously in June 1816. Both bore the names of their respective publishers—Coburn in London and Treuttel & Wurtz in Paris. As to which edition came first, scholars have yet to reach a consensus. Between June 25–27, 1816, after reading the first reviews, Constant wrote a “preface to the second edition,” intended to assure readers that the characters depicted were entirely fictional. At the end of June, Coburn began pasting this preface into remaining copies, replacing the title page with one marked “Second Edition.” However, Madame de Staël’s approval and the reassurances of the Paris publisher calmed Constant, and he deemed the new preface unnecessary.
The “Second Edition” was printed in very limited numbers—only eight copies survive today. At the end of August 1816, an English translation of Adolphe was published in London. In 1817, the novel was translated into German, and in 1824, the third French edition appeared in Paris—the last one corrected by Constant himself.

The first edition of Adolphe generated great interest among readers, though many critics received it with reserve, noting romantic innovations in style and romantic egoism in the characters’ actions. Yet the novel also had its champions: Stendhal highly valued it; critic G. Planche wrote in 1824 that in all French literature, there were hardly “three poems as true as this work”; and Balzac, though writing in a different style, consistently praised Adolphe as a novel “based on facts and observations,” and therefore not stillborn, but alive. Balzac even wrote his own variation of Adolphe’s plot in La Muse du département, whose heroine called Adolphe her Bible and said she feared nothing more than becoming like Ellenora. Nevertheless, in the 19th century, the novel was republished relatively rarely—only 15 editions appeared between 1833 and 1900—and it was even less frequently studied. A turning point came in 1889, when editions with forewords by Paul Bourget and Anatole France were published simultaneously. From 1900 to 1970, Adolphe was republished 93 times and became the subject of numerous articles, monographs, and dissertations.

Constant presents Adolphe as a manuscript written by the protagonist, which came into the hands of a “publisher” and was released with the consent of a friend of the deceased Adolphe. The text, allegedly written by Adolphe himself, contains a detailed analysis of the psychological mechanisms driving his actions. The other characters—including Ellenora—are seen through Adolphe’s eyes and play secondary roles. Through Adolphe’s story, Constant explores how sincere motives and thoughts born of vanity coexist in the human soul, how fulfilled desire turns into indifference, how the yearning for independence clashes with the need for affection, how one hides the motives of their actions from themselves, and how they are torn between selfishness and compassion. Adolphe’s character is revealed so fully through his love for Ellenora that, as the author notes, one can judge all other stages of his life from this episode. It is clear that he “did not excel in any field, squandered his abilities, was guided only by whim, and drew strength only from animosity.”

Unlike Alfred de Musset, who in Confession of the Son of the Century identified historical and social forces shaping his hero’s character, Constant focuses solely on character. In the novel’s finale, the “publisher” states: “Circumstances are not of great importance; the gist is in character.” The psychological type to which Adolphe belongs—a sensitive egoist, driven by impulse rather than principle, unable to follow through on decisions, constantly analyzing his feelings and horrified by his own inconsistency—did not vanish in later eras. But in the early 19th century, readers saw in Adolphe their contemporary, “the son of the century.” According to G. Planche, secular readers recognized themselves in Constant’s hero and read their own sentence.

Adolphe is a novel about a modern hero, but its style had nothing in common with the verbose sentimental novels popular among early 19th-century readers, especially women. Constant’s contemporaries first noted his stylistic features—such as unconventional epithets—which they tended to label romantic. Today, it is more evident that Constant followed the tradition of psychological prose from the 17th and 18th centuries (La Rochefoucauld, Vauvenargues, Madame de Lafayette, Marivaux, or Choderlos de Laclos, author of Dangerous Liaisons), where the subtlest shades of feeling are analyzed and the results of ruthless psychological insight are expressed in laconic maxims.
