Snow Country (“Yukiguni”) is a tale by Yasunari Kawabata. The work was begun in 1934 and completed in 1947. It was published in parts starting in 1935 across various magazines. An unfinished version was first published in 1937 under the title Snow Country by Sagensha in Tokyo.
This tale is not only considered Kawabata’s finest work but also a masterpiece of lyrical prose in 20th-century Japanese literature. It embodies the classical Japanese concept of beauty. In 1968, Kawabata was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his “writing skill that expresses with great feeling the essence of the Japanese way of thinking.”

Kawabata’s artistic sensibility and his understanding of poetic language are deeply connected to the “initial image” of Zen poetry. Zen aesthetics reject intellectualized perception, instead affirming that unclouded childlike wonder, natural simplicity, and emotional elegance are the true marks of an artist. The creative process, according to this view, does not rely on a predetermined, structured plan but rather on simplicity and complete spontaneity.

Snow Country was written over a long period. Initially, the author had no clear idea of the genre. His first novel, Mirror of the Evening Scene, was published in 1935. The concept of yojō - the lingering after-feeling - sparked a wave of poetic associations in Kawabata, prompting him to begin work on a new novel. Thus emerged a series of sketches, connected not by plot but by a shared lyrical mood. As Kawabata himself noted, “This work can be interrupted at any place, and the inception doesn’t correspond to the end.” Snow Country, Thousand Cranes (1949), The Sound of the Mountain (1954), The Old Capital (1962), and Palm-of-the-Hand Stories were all written under the influence of Zen Buddhism.

At the heart of Snow Country are the characters of two beautiful Japanese women - young Yoko and the geisha Komako - with whom Shimamura, a talented man unable to apply his abilities in public life, begins an intimate relationship. He is portrayed as a kind of “spare person.” Through Shimamura’s perception, Kawabata poetically renders the female characters, making their idealization a central feature of the novel.

Komako captivates Shimamura not only with her physical beauty but also with her spiritual purity, which reflects the Japanese ideal of beauty: “He looked in her direction... The depth of the mirror was completely white, the mirror reflected the snow, and against this background, the woman’s face was scarlet and burning. An amazingly pure beauty.” To convey the charm of a Japanese woman, Kawabata presents her image both frontally and in profile through a mirror’s reflection. This pictorial technique recalls Utamaro’s famous 18th-century series Seven Women Applying Make-up Using a Mirror. Like Utamaro, Kawabata seeks not merely to depict but to express the essence of a woman’s face. The “piercing beauty” of the image is elevated into poetic contemplation.

Kawabata’s works lack the image of the heroic warrior. He does not view life through the lens of heroism but instead seeks lyricism in everyday existence. By affirming universal harmony and equality in a fleeting, changeable life, he celebrates the beauty of gentle femininity in contrast to brute masculine strength. During wartime, this perspective served as a quiet protest against the prevailing spirit of the era. The snowy country, isolated by mountains and long tunnels, becomes a symbol of resistance to harsh reality. Kawabata glorifies ancient cultural traditions rooted in the ideals of peace, elegance, subtlety, and beauty.

This story is not only about beauty and love but also about ordinary people living modest lives, filled with work and care for loved ones in a harsh, snowy landscape. Its subtle and elegant narrative style is organically blended with realism.

The story features an unusual character structure. The main characters live independently, as if detached from one another, with their paths rarely intersecting. This type of work can be described as “linear,” in contrast to “orchestral” compositions, where life is portrayed as a complex interweaving of destinies. It is believed that the “linear” structure closely aligns with traditional Japanese narrative composition.

The story has received mixed assessments. Some critics consider Kawabata’s work outdated, a relic of yesterday’s literature, arguing that modern Japanese thought has evolved beyond traditional notions of peace and beauty. However, Japanese theorist and critic Aono Suekichi refuted such claims: “Every time I read Kawabata’s works, I feel the sounds around me stop and the air becomes transparent and pure. This is because there is nothing cloudy or vulgar in Kawabata’s lyrical prose... And if one day, at the whim of time, his work—immersed in the world of pure beauty—is dismissed as empty entertainment, it will be a true loss for our literature.”
