The novel was finished at the beginning of 1936 and was published later the same year by Random House. Its title references the biblical legend of King David’s son, Absalom, who was killed while attempting to dethrone his father. Through the lens of timeless human truths, Faulkner explores the tragedy of the American South, specifically the violation of unwritten moral laws. The narrative is set in 1909 and centers around Colonel Sutpen, whose story is told through the perspectives of four narrators, each possessing only partial information about events that occurred decades earlier. Thomas Sutpen is depicted as a man of immense willpower and determination. He begins his life with nothing, amassing wealth and a respectable position in society. However, he ultimately suffers a downfall due to his perception of others not as individuals but as mere tools in his pursuit of selfish objectives. Faulkner suggests that every person contributes something unique to life's tapestry, and the “threads” they pull are interwoven with others. Thus, nothing goes unnoticed; the past has the potential to ruin the future.  In his youth in Haiti, Sutpen married the daughter of a rich planter, Eulalia Bon. The son was born, but Sutpen abandoned the wife and the son when he discovered the child had African ancestry, which he believed would hinder his ambitious plans. Upon returning to America, Sutpen married again. He purchased a large, fertile plot of land from Indigenous people and began constructing a mansion. When his French architect fled due to the harsh living conditions, Sutpen chased him with dogs and held him captive until the building was completed. 

Revenge from Sutpen’s past arrived in the form of Charles Bon, the son of Sutpen’s first wife, who sought to marry his half-sister, Judith. Bon met his death at the hands of his half-brother, Henry Sutpen. While Henry considered Bon a friend and could tolerate the idea of an incestuous union, he could not overcome his racial prejudice. The Civil War severely impacted Sutpen’s fortunes. In his old age, he was reduced to managing a small shop, aided by Wash Jones, his loyal servant and companion for many years.

Meanwhile, Sutpen was desperate to secure an heir at any cost, as Henry hid following Charles’s murder. The birth of a daughter would spell disaster for him. This obsession alienated Rosa Coldfield, the sister of his deceased wife, whom Sutpen had previously asked to prove her capability of bearing him a son. Wash, understanding Sutpen’s motivations, accepted the colonel's attention towards his granddaughter, Milly. Even Milly's pregnancy by Sutpen, who was nearly fifty years her senior, did not shock Jones. However, Sutpen’s remark upon the birth of a girl - “Well, Milly,” Sutpen said, “too bad you’re not a mare. Then I could give you a decent stall in the stable”- shattered everything. Jones then killed Sutpen, feeling that the colonel had undermined his belief in an idealized heroic America and the resilient, albeit defeated, South, leaving his own existence devoid of meaning. 

Sutpen’s story underscores Faulkner's central thesis: the tragedy of the South is not marked by conflict with the North but by the inception of the era of slavery in American history. This, in fact, lays the foundation for Sutpen’s moral transgressions, which became a heavy burden for his descendants.
